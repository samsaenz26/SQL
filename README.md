# Sam Saenz's SQL Portfolio

# *Welcome to my SQL Portfolio!*

This repository showcases a collection of SQL queries and projects I've worked on, ranging from data cleaning and transformation to complex joins and performance optimization. Whether you're exploring for inspiration or evaluating my work, I invite you to browse through the examples. Each project highlights different aspects of my SQL experience and problem-solving skills.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.

Thanks for stopping by! :)
